          <h2>About Mike Tyson</h2>
          <p>
            "Iron Mike" Tyson is one of the most iconic figures in boxing
            history. Born on June 30, 1966, in Brooklyn, New York, Tyson rose to
            fame as the youngest boxer ever to win a heavyweight title at just
            20 years old. Known for his ferocious and intimidating style, Tyson
            dominated the ring with a combination of speed, power, and
            aggression, making him one of the most feared fighters of all time.
